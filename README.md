# Iterators-and-Generators-in-python
This code help you to understand what is generators and iterators in python.
Have you ever had to work with a dataset so large that it overwhelmed your machine’s memory? 
Or maybe you have a complex function that needs to maintain an internal state every time it’s called, but the function is too small to justify creating its own class.

-Generators and the Python yield statement are here to help.


Keep fun with coding ^_^
